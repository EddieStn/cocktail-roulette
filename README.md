## Forking and Cloning

## Forking a repository
### A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the EddieStn/cocktail-roulette repository.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

## Cloning your forked repository
### Right now, you have a fork of the Art-of-fitness repository, but you do not have the files in that repository locally on your computer.
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to your fork of the Cocktail-roulette repository.
2. Above the list of files, click Code.
3. Copy the URL for the repository.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:
   - git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Cocktail-roulette
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

# Deployment
### The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the Code and automation click on Pages
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch and click Save
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
